FouleFactoryApiLib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC v2.0

How To Configure:
=================
The generated client class accepts the configuration parameters in its constructors.

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a java library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a maven dependency in the generated gradle build
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

For build process do the following:

    1. Open Android Studio and use "Import Project" option. 
    2. Browse to the generated SDK, select the unarchived folder "FouleFactoryApiLib" and click "Ok".
    3. Press Ctrl+F9 or use "Make Project" menu command to build and resolve all dependencies.


How To Use:
===========
The build process generates android libaray, which can be used just like an
ordinary AAR library. See the following link for more information on this
topic.
